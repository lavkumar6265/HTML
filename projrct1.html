    In this post, we’ll check out some <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-website-designs-list"> <span>stunning website examples</span>that leverage</a> <br>
    HTML to its fullest potential. We’ll also discuss some ideas for building your <br>
    first HTML website. But first, what actually is an “HTML website”?
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">HTML Websites</h2>
    <br>
    <p>HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the primary <br>
    language of the World Wide Web. An HTML document sets the content and <br>
    structure of a web page. When you view a page in your browser, what <br>
    you’re looking at is your browser’s interpretation of an HTML file that was <br>
    retrieved from a web server.
    </p>

    <p>
    HTML is almost always used in conjunction with two other front-end <br>
    languages, CSS and JavaScript. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a rules <br>
    language which controls the styling of a web page, including colors, fonts,<br>
    and layouts. JavaScript is a programming language that enables more <br>
    complex features like interactive elements and animations.
    </p>

    <p>The latest version of HTML is HTML5. Released in 2008, HTML5 notably<br>
    contained several improvements to handle multimedia content like audio<br>
    and video, as well as <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/semantic-html"><span> semantically rich elements</span></a> to describe page<br>
    structure.</p>

    understand this post.</p>

    <p>Every website is written in HTML, regardless of the complexity of the site or <br>
    the number of technologies involved. You can take any page and lift up the <br>
    hood to see the HTML code, as well as the CSS and JavaScript code, that <br>
    make it come to life. In the next section, we’ll review some of the ways <br>
   <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-designer-vs-web-developer"> <span>designers and developers</span></a>harness HTML in their creative work.</p>

   <h2>Ideas for HTML Websites</h2>
   <p>
    To get comfortable with HTML (along with CSS and JavaScript), it’s a good <br>
    idea to create a website or two from scratch. Even a relatively simple HTML <br>
    website can teach you many of its intricacies and capabilities, and provides <br>
    you with a solid foundation before you move on to more advanced projects.
   </p>

    experience, interests, skills, and personality. This is a project you can return to and
    revise over time as your skills develop. </li><br>
    <li><strong>An informational site :</strong> Pick a topic you’re interested in, then code up a simple 
    website that teaches visitors about it.</li><br>
